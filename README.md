This is a web app originally based on John Elder's Ruby on Rails course.

##Features
The features to implement are:
  1. Complete Catalogue of MESBG miniatures
  2. Tags that correspond to miniature's Character, Faction and Original Release Wave.
  3. User unique miniature collection list
  4. User unique "Want to get" tag which includes the quantity (if you want more than one of the same mini!)
